# Word-Frequency-Counter
This project is a Word Frequency Counter written in C++. The program takes user input for a specified number of words, identifies unique words, and counts the frequency of each word. It serves as a simple demonstration of C++ programming concepts, including arrays, loops, and conditional statements.

# Introduction
The Word Frequency Counter project was developed to help users understand word frequency in a set of input words. The program prompts the user to input the number of words they wish to analyze, then reads each word and calculates the frequency of each unique word. By doing this, the project provides a simple introduction to C++ syntax, control structures, and basic data handling.

# Features
Counts word frequency: Identifies each unique word and its occurrence count from the userâ€™s input.
User-friendly interface: Prompts the user step-by-step to input the required data.

# Requirements
To compile and run the program, you will need: A C++ compiler, such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio.
A command-line interface (CLI), like Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux.

# Usage
1. Enter the Number of Words: The program first prompts you to enter the number of words you wish to analyze. This input determines how many words the program will read and process.
2. Enter the Words: After specifying the number of words, enter each word when prompted. The program will take each word as input and check for duplicates.
3. View the Output: After processing the input, the program outputs each unique word along with its frequency count.

# Example
Input:
Enter number of words: 5
Enter the words:
apple banana apple orange banana

Output:
apple 2
banana 2
orange 1
